\section{Summary}

A girl is wandering through the forest, playing near a lake. She hears a mysterious voice: a call, beckoning her to the water. There she discovers her true calling.

\section{Gameplay}

The player operates in first person, exploring the area surrounding the lake. The mysterious voice will beckon to the player, but the player won't know where it's coming from. The main obstacle to the player is a lack of familiarity with the environment, and not knowing where the voice is coming from. 

\section{Mindset}

The player should be intrigued, seeking to discover what the voice is, where it's coming from, and who it belongs to.

\chapter{Technical}
